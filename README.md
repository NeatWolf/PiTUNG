Mod framework for [The Ultimate Nerd Game](https://iamsodarncool.itch.io/tung). You can download all the mods I've made [here](https://github.com/pipe01/pitung-mods).

You can get the latest version of PiTUNG right out of the oven [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/pipe01/pitung/artifacts/bin%2FDebug%2FPiTung.dll). **DISCLAIMER**: this version is built from the latest commit, which means that it most likely won't work reliably. You probably don't want to download this version, but rather [this one](https://github.com/pipe01/PiTUNG/releases/latest).

## For users: How to install the framework

Installing the framework is extremely easy, just download [the installer](http://www.pipe0481.heliohost.org/pitung/Installer.exe) to the same folder as "The Ultimate Nerd Game.exe", and double-click it!

## For developers: How to create a mod

See [the documentation](http://pipe01.github.io/PiTUNG).

This framework uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) under the hood, so you may want to take a look at its documentation if you need more flexibility.
